## Distributed systems
A distributed system is several systems networked together to allow access to their shared resources. This gives the illusion of a single system.
Systems abstract more or less over network functions.
Generally, two or mor esystems connected together over som medium forms a network. They use some protocol to communicate in a standard way. Networks are caraterized by distance, like LAN and WAN. A network operating system provides features across the network and operates autonomously from other computers on the network.
