## Computing environments
Some interesting notes on environments where operating systems must run:
- Client-server computing:
    - Compute-server systems perform some compute by request
    - File-server systems allow CRUD access to files(web server)
- Peer-to-peer computing
    - Can use centralized or decentralized lookup to discover services in the network. Each node in the network can be either a client or server depending on the request. Can be very efficient for video and voice calling to save on server costs.
- Cloud computing
    - Sort of virtualization over the internet.
    - Delivers services, apps, etc
    - Public vs. private: available to the highest bidder or owned and used by a company (there is also hybrid)
    - SaaS, PaaS, IaaS
    - Some complex service systems of systems require management systems that could be considered operating systems themselves
- Real time system
    - Has well defined, fixed time constraints for processing(otherwise it is a failure).
