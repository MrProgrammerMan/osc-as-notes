# Chapter 1.6
## Security and Protection
The OS defines and manages several resources. These must be protected from misuse by unathorized processes or users. A process may only operated within its allocated memory address space. The timer prevents a process from seizing control of the CPU and not returning it to the OS. Device-control registers are inaccessible to users. And so on…
**Protection** is any mechanism for controlling access for processes or users to the resources. It must provide means to specify controls to be imposed and enforce them.
Protection can potentially detect latent errors, and prevent a malfunctioning subsystem from breaking other subsystems.

Protection is not the same as security, which defends against internal or external attack. _Some_ OSs do _some_ security.

A part of protection is distinguishing users with user and group IDs. Often, privilage escalation mechanisms exist to temporarily execute code as a different user.
