## Virtualization
We can run an OS as a process inside of another OS. This is different to emulation, where different hardware is emulated to run unsupported programs. We can abstract iver the hardware and create an illusion of seperate computers as different environments. This allows running code not written for your OS, for testing, experimentation, compatibility, etc. Its widely used in servers, sometimes to allow multiple users to operate independently and share a single physical machine in isolation and with protection against each other. The program that manages virtaul machines is called a **virtual machine manager(VMM)**. Entire OSs exist whose whole purpose is virtualization.
